# File Size Calculator Kata

https://gist.github.com/agualis/86f45e60edc898f75ef0

## GOAL 
* Given a filesystem path, our goal is to calculate the total size of all the files under that directory (and it's subdirectories).

## Build
* I'm using gradle so I can run the tests in my CI server when I commit. 
* If you don't want to use it you would need to import mockito jar to be able to run the tests. 

## Design Patterns
* We have applied factory and composite patterns although I didn't commit the steps so you can see how to refactor in green. Ping me if you have any doubt.
